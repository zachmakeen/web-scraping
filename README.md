# Web Scraping

This project consists of obtaining data revolving around Covid-19 from the web and then storing it into a database. The data will then be used to produce charts representing different pieces of data.
To run the program, you must first choose whether you want to scrape an existing file/download an html file containing data from today and the past two days or if you want to analyze data that is currently in the database.
